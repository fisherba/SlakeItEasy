This vignette outlines a typical workflow using SlakeItEasy to quantify soil aggregate stability from images. See the package [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Soil-Health-Institute/SlakeItEasy/) for instructions on package installation and required file structure and naming conventions. If you want to analyze soils in the field and only need to process one soil sample at a time, check out the Slakes app for Android or iPhone.

A brief note for users without prior R experience: SlakeItEasy is a set of tools (called *functions*) designed to make it easier to quantify the expansion of soils submerged in water. We make a few assumptions about how images were collected and the settings for image processing in the workflow illustrated here and in the default function arguments. To learn more about what each function does and the settings that can be changed, type `?functionname` in the console.

##download EBimage first time
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("EBImage")

##install slake it easy first time
# install {remotes} if missing
if (!require(remotes)) {
install.packages('remotes')
}
# install latest version of {SlakeItEasy} from GitHub repository
remotes::install_github('Soil-Health-Institute/SlakeItEasy')


## Load required packages

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(EBImage)
library(dplyr)
library(SlakeItEasy)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60), tidy = TRUE
)
```



## Set paths to images and output directory

SlakeItEasy is designed to analyze batches of images. We need to tell R where on the computer the image batch is saved and where we want to save files related to image processing and our final aggregate stability data.

The SlakeItEasy package provides the function `set_paths()` for users that prefer to use the file browser to specify locations of images and file output. For output, select a general directory where results for multiple batches can be saved.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
paths <- set_paths()
```

Alternatively, you can specify `paths` non-interactively by defining a named list with the image directory, output directory, and batch name.

```{r, eval=F}
paths <- list(image_dir = '/path/to/image/directory',
              output_dir = '/path/to/output/directory',
              batch_name = 'mybatch')
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
paths <- list(image_dir = system.file("images/", package="SlakeItEasy"),
              output_dir = tempdir(),
              batch_name = paste0('batch_', format(Sys.Date(), '%Y%m%d')))
```

## Set up directories for output

Create a batch-specific directory for processing outputs. By default, `dir_setup` will also create subdirectories that we will use later to sort images.

```{r}

dirs_for_flagged_imgs <- dir_setup(paths$output_dir,  return_paths = T)

# extract paths to subdirectories for images that need to be processed interactively and for images that cannot be analyzed (requiring samples be rerun)

reprocess_dir <- dirs_for_flagged_imgs['to_reprocess']
unusable_dir <- dirs_for_flagged_imgs['unusable']
```

## Inspect image metadata

SlakeItEasy extracts image attributes from file names and from EXIF metadata (see `?exifr::read_exif`). As described [here](https://github.com/Soil-Health-Institute/SlakeItEasy/), sample IDs and replicate numbers should be represented by directory names, not image file names. Image file names should contain the date and time of image acquisition. (Note: default function arguments assume images were collected with the OpenCamera Android app.)

##Canon EOS T3 metadata format: <xmp:CreateDate>2025-02-21T14:13:44</xmp:CreateDate>
## also formatted as 2025-02-21 14:13:44.013 



```{r}
metadata <- get_metadata(paths$image_dir, filename_prefix = 'IMG_')
```

Images in the directory specified by `paths$image_dir` are assumed to be arranged by replicate: that is, an individual set of aggregates that were photographed in the air-dry state, immediately after submersion, and after a specified time in water  (by default, ten minutes ±30 seconds). Use `check_replicates` to identify image sets that deviate from these expectations.

```{r}
metadata_qaqc <- check_replicates(metadata,  final_img_time_min = 10, final_img_tol_sec = 30, n_images_max = 3)

# save metadata summary to output directory
write.csv(metadata_qaqc$m, file.path(paths$output_dir, 'qaqc_log.csv'), row.names = F)

metadata_qaqc$usable
metadata_qaqc$missing_imgs
metadata_qaqc$extra_imgs
metadata_qaqc$wrong_final_time

# metadata[metadata$Directory %in% metadata_qaqc$wrong_final_time,]

# inspect replicates with extra images
if (length(metadata_qaqc$extra_imgs) > 0) {
  opendirs(metadata_qaqc$extra_imgs)
}
```

## Process individual images

The suitability of default function arguments and need for alternative values can be evaluated by running `mask_image_circular()` and/or `area_from_image()`. If the sample container (Petri dish) is off-center in the image, modify the mask offsets (`h_offset` and `v_offset`). If the mask needs to be resized, modify the relative diameter of the mask (`d`).

```{r, eval = F}
img <- read_to_portrait(with(metadata[1,], paste0(Directory, '/', FileName)))
img_masked <- mask_image_circular(img, interactive = T, h_offset = 0)
plot(img_masked)

test <- area_from_image(with(metadata[1,], paste0(Directory, '/', FileName)), circular_mask = T, d = 0.73, interactive = T)
```

## Automated batch processing with a circular crop

```{r, eval = F}
results <- batch_process(dir_vec = to_analyze, outdir = paths$output_dir, filename_prefix = 'IMG_', match_resolution = T, circular_mask = T, parallel = T)
```

## Inspect classifications and sort suboptimal images

```{r, eval = F}
reprocess_dir <- dirs_for_flagged_imgs['to_reprocess']
unusable_dir <- dirs_for_flagged_imgs['unusable']
opendirs(c(unusable_dir, reprocess_dir, paste0(paths$output_dir, '/images_false_color')))
```

## Prepare for manual processing

```{r, eval = F}
images_to_reprocess <- list.files(reprocess_dir)

dir_vec2 <- unique(sapply(strsplit(images_to_reprocess, '_x_'), function(x) paste(x[1:(length(x) - 1)], collapse = '/')))
```
